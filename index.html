<a id="welcome-flextimemonitor" class="anchor" href="#welcome-flextimemonitor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome FlexTimeMonitor.</h3>

<p>This application helps you to keep track of your working hours by monitoring your computers daily uptime. </p>

<h2>
<a id="highlights" class="anchor" href="#highlights" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>clear and lean user interface</li>
<li>editable history</li>
<li>supports notes</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="how-does-it-work" class="anchor" href="#how-does-it-work" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does it work?</h3>

<p>When the FlexTimeMonitor is started it creates a new history entry for the current workday. But it only keeps the very first entry for that day in the history. That way no computer restarts or are logged. It also stores the shutdown time for each workday. But again only the last shutdown is stored.
Same happens when the computer enters or leaves a power saving mode.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-it-cant" class="anchor" href="#what-it-cant" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What it can't</h3>

<p>Although FlexTimeMonitor uses a pretty solid algorithm to detect the daily working hours it can not detect day switches. So if you work night shifts this application is not for you (at least at the moment).
Since it tries to save your history whenever the computer shuts down it works under critical conditions where data loss can occur - although very rarely. The risk is especially high for forced shutdowns. In this case you can lose you complete history. <strong>Create backups of the history file!</strong></p>

<h3>
<a id="privacy-concerns" class="anchor" href="#privacy-concerns" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Privacy concerns</h3>

<p>This application has been developed with privacy concerns in mind. It only stores the absolute minimum of required data and stores it only locally in your home directory. It does not monitor your activities or mouse movement. The history is located in:
'''C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Flex Time Monitor\History.xml'''</p>
