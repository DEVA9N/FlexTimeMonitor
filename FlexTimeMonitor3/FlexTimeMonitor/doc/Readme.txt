1. About:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program keeps track of your work time. Once installed it will log your PCs'
start and shutdown. With this data it can easily calculate your attendance. The 
results are shown as table. Some entries can be altered (Start, End, Discrepancy,
Note).

The collected history data is stored in an xml file in:
\My Documents\Flex Time Monitor\History.xml

2. Install:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make a backup of your history and deinstall (important) any previous versions of
Flex Time Monitor before proceeding.

1. Unzip files
2. Run setup.exe
3. Copy the FlexTimeMonitor link to autostart
4. done

3. Usage:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can use the automatic start method to log your personal working hours. You
may also start and close it manually and use it to log certain periods of time 
(e.g. for a certain project).

Restarting your computer is no problem at all. Flex Time Monitor will automatically
log the correct start and end. The start is always the first start of your computer
on that day. The end is always the last shutdown on that same day.

Selecting multiple entries will show an overview of the overall time worked and
the time you should have worked. This is shown in the status bar.

You can add notes to your log file (e.g. working at home). It is possible to
edit the table fields for start and end too.

It's important to minimize the program if you want it to be minimized! A lot of
programms in the history used the close button to minimize. This doesn't make 
sense and so most applications today use the buttons accordingly. So does Flex
Time Monitor.

A right click on the Flex Time Monitor icon that can be found in the systray
reveals information about the current workday. For example how many hours you
have left before you can go home.

5. Edit settings:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The application offers a config dialogue for certain option such as break time
and work period. 

4. Limitations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
If your work period starts on one day and ends on another (e.g. start at 20:00, 
end at 04:00) Flex Time Monitor is unable to keep a proper history.
