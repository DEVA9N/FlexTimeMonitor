# The project moved to [github](https://github.com/DEVA9N/FlexTimeMonitor) #
This is due the [Google announcement](http://google-opensource.blogspot.de/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html) to shutdown google code.






This .NET4.0 application helps you to keep track of your working hours. It will observe the computer start and shutdown to create a complete history of your working time.

The history is shown as table. You can add your own notes as well as calculate your overall work period. A systray icon informs you over the most important data such as starting time, estimated ending and time left.

**Since google hast stopped supporting project downloads please go to to http://a9n.de to download any new releases of Flextime Monitor.**
